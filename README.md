# Middle Level Python

In this proyect, I will work with some new concepts like POO, debugging etc...

Like in the basic proyect, I will document every folder of my work in this file, just down here:

## File Control

Within, I have two new folders:

1. For save all the data that I'm going to modify.

2. *file_control.py* include some file operations like read or write on a .txt

## Filtering Data

Inside, there is one program that I use to practice some High Order Functions. Added some dictionary and list comprehensions exercises too

## Debugging 

Inside, I work with a simple program called *assert_statements.py* that use the assert statement to check if the user sent a possitive number, and if that's not the case, send a message asking for a number

In the file *debugging.py*, I test the try...except and catch statements

## Hangman Game

This game consist in the classical game of hangman, and you have six lives to win the computer. This game generates a word from a set of words stored in words.txt (you can find all files attached on data folder) and you need to guess the word 
before hangman appears.
I have used list comprehesions, error handling and others advanced programatic things

## POO

You'll find two folders inside:

1. POOUberCourse have some basic concepts of Object-oriented programming (POO). The idea of this folder is to imitate behavior of the famous Uber car service in 4 different languages (Java, JS, PHP and Python)

2. POOPython directory contains a variety of  more complex exercises about decorators, @property, optimization etc...

## Loose Exercises

On this directory you can find some exercises that I have used to practice, but they are too simple to separate
