# Python Nivel Intermedio

There are some exercises more difficult than on the easy level of Python

## Filtering Data

Inside, there are one program that use some of the High Order Functions for practise. I added some dictionary and list comprehensions exercises too

## Debugging 

On the file debugging.py, I upload code for practise the art of debug

## Ejercicios Sueltos

On that directory you can find some exercises that I used to practise, but they where too simple to separate them.
